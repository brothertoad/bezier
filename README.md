# B&eacute;zier interpolation

This module calculates a set of B&eacute;zier splines that represent a continuous curve
through a set of points.  Both integer and floating point versions are provided.
I use this to create curves in SVG files.

The algorithm was ported from the Javascript on
[this page](https://www.particleincell.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/bezier-spline.js).
The page describing what the codes does is
[here](https://www.particleincell.com/2012/bezier-splines/).  This page also
provides a little interactive demo.
